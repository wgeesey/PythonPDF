# PythonPDF
Script for opening, merging and watermarking PDFs

## Command line args
From the commmand line the arguments from index 1+ will be put into a list and used for the merging part of the script.
Ex: python pdf.py pdf1.pdf pdf2.pdf pdf3.pdf  will result in: inputs = ['pdf1.py', 'pdf2.py', 'pdf3.py'] for example.

### Credit
Again, credit to Udemy/ZTM for introducing me to the PyPDF2 library and issuing a challenge after explaining the library and some of the methods. I utilized online-documentation to complete the watermarking and mergining sections.
